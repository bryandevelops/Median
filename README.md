Median is a Medium application clone that allows users to publish their own stories. Whether amateur or professional, short or extended, Median is the perfect hub for any form of social journalism.

## Technologies

For the Frontend, Median uses a combination of React for the Framework, Redux for State Management, and ES6 JavaScript to generate a single-page experience for the User. On the Backend it uses the Ruby on Rails framework for Data Management. Lastly, jQuery was used to generate all the AJAX requests to the Backend.
